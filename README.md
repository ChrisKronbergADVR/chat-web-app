&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- if it returns a version number for python, it is working correctly. It should return =>  Python 3.9.7

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- if it does not return python with a version number try the suggestions below in a terminal or command prompt: 

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;```py --version```

- You can click the copy button to copy the code and then add git clone to the beginning of it in a terminal or command prompt. I have already copied and added git clone so you do not have to do that with the text below. you can just copy what is below and paste it  ito a terminal or command prompt.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;```git clone https://github.com/ckronber/chat-web-app.git```
