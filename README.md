<h4>&ensp; 2. Check the python version to make sure it is installed with the command below</h4>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;```python --version```

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- if it returns a version number for python, it is working correctly. It should return =>  Python 3.9.7

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- if it does not return python with a version number try the suggestions below in a terminal or command prompt: 

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;```py --version```

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;```python3 --version```
